#Sysunconfig

This is an ansible role primarily intended to accomany my [on-prem to Azure](https://github.com/jritenour/azure-migration) Red Hat CloudForms automation method.  It can be used as a standalone Linux/Windows sysprep/sysuncofig playbook, but note that it does install the Windows Linux Azure agent on Linux VMs.
